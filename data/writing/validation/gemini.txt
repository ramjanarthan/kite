The vibrant crimson of the rubber ball stood out against the emerald green of the park as Finn hurled it skyward, his laughter echoing in the crisp autumn air. A tiny, scruffy terrier puppy, all legs and boundless energy, bounded after the soaring sphere, its floppy ears flapping with each enthusiastic leap. Sunlight dappled through the golden leaves overhead, painting shifting patterns on the scene as the puppy, Pip, finally snatched the ball, tail wagging furiously, and skidded to a halt at Finnâ€™s feet. Suddenly, a gust of wind, stronger than any before, swept through the park, lifting not only fallen leaves but, inexplicably, the bright red ball as well, carrying it in a dizzying spiral high above the startled boy and his bewildered pup. Pip barked in confusion, jumping and snapping at the retreating toy, while Finn could only stare, mouth agape, at the improbable sight of his ball dancing in the wind like a vibrant leaf itself.
