In the soft glow of a late summer afternoon, when the sun spilled like honey over the edge of the world and shadows stretched long and lazy across the fields, a boy named Felix chased after a red ball that gleamed like a cherry dropped from heaven. His laughter rang clear as a bell, carried on the warm breeze, and his puppy, Juno—a wiry, white-furred whirlwind with paws too big for her body—barked and bounded beside him, caught in the same thrill of movement and light. The ball bounced erratically down the hill, flashing in and out of sunbeams, rolling past wildflowers and dragonflies, and the chase became a blur of joyful noise and clumsy footfalls. Felix sprinted faster, his bare feet brushing the grass, then with one final burst of energy, he launched the ball high into the sky—too high, so high it seemed to disappear into the sun itself. He and Juno stopped, shielding their eyes, scanning the sky, waiting for it to fall back. But it didn’t. Seconds passed. Then a minute. And then the sky began to darken—not with clouds, but with something else, something stranger. A rippling distortion spread across the sky where the ball had vanished, like a ripple in water but stitched into the very fabric of the air, and a faint, low hum began to rise, vibrating in Felix’s chest like the deep note of a cello string drawn too tight. Juno whimpered and pressed against his leg, eyes locked on the sky as the ripple grew and spiraled outward, revealing a glowing seam that split open, just a sliver, like the blink of a giant hidden eye. From within that seam, the red ball came tumbling back, but not as it had gone—it glowed with a gentle, pulsing light, and it moved not with gravity, but with purpose, descending slowly to hover inches above the ground. Felix reached out with a trembling hand, but before he could touch it, the ball emitted a sudden flash, and every blade of grass in a ten-foot radius flattened as though pressed by an invisible hand. In that moment, time itself seemed to pause; the air held its breath. Then, just as quickly, the ball fell to the earth with an innocent bounce, looking ordinary again, as if nothing had happened at all. Birds resumed their song. The sun returned to its golden brilliance. But Felix stood frozen, staring at the ball, while Juno barked once, sharply, and backed away. Something had seen them—something from beyond the sky—and it had returned the ball not as a toy, but as a message. And deep down, in a place he couldn’t name, Felix knew: the game was only just beginning.
